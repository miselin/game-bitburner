Contract Type: Encryption I: Caesar Cipher, 10 tries remain
Description: Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption technique. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext  is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A,  E would become B, and A would become X (because of rotation).

 You are given an array with two elements:
 &nbsp;&nbsp;["TABLE ENTER SHELL LOGIC MEDIA", 5]
 The first element is the plaintext, the second element is the left shift value.

 Return the ciphertext as uppercase string. Spaces remains the same.
Data: <<TABLE ENTER SHELL LOGIC MEDIA,5>>
